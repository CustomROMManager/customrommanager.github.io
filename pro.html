                    <h2>What's extra in pro?</h2>
                    The pro version not only brings all the stuff from free version (obvious much?), but also provides users with much more control and customisation options, has no ads, and is much less in size than free version.<br>
                    <h3>Features</h3>
                    <strong>NO ADS</strong><br>
                    Custom ROM Manager Pro contains absolutely no ads. You won't find ads in any screens (even by mistake).<br><br>
                    <strong>HAVE BETTER CONTROL ON HOW ZIP FILES ARE SEARCHED</strong><br>
                    One of the biggest strengths of Custom ROM Manager is how fast it searches for files in the device. On any modern device with Micro SD Card installed (apart from the usual internal storage), it can find all the useful zip files in under 0.5s across both the storages. The reason why it is so fast is basically because of these 2 reasons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>It searches where it should.</li>
                        <li>It does not search where it shouldn't.</li>
                    </ul>
                    While there is a restriction in free version which does not let to remove the main storage location entries from the locations where the app would search for zip files. The pro version removes this restriction, letting users to remove the default locations, and specifying exact storage locations where the zip files are usually present, making search result instantaenous. Additionally, Custom ROM Manager does not look into irrelevant folders where useful zip files wont usually be present. Pro version removes this restriction, letting users have total control on which folders are skipped while zip files are searched for, further boosting the search speeds.<br>
                    <strong>HAVE BETTER CONTROL ON HOW ZIP FILES ARE SEARCHED</strong><br>
                    Custom ROM Manager checks the size of a file to determine whether a zip file is a ROM or a GApps package or some other kind of zip file. In this way the app is able to distinguish between an actual ROM and zip files related to that ROM (like firmware, patches etc). The pro version lets users to have control on this 'size' parameter. This is important because, often, patches and firmwares have file names matching their corresponding ROM names, which often leads the app to detect it as ROM (although the way this setting is tuned by default is good enough for normal use cases), but letting users having a control on this brings more flexibility in operation
